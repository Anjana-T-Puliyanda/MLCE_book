# Welcome to Machine Learning in Chemical Engineering! ðŸ‘‹

This book is intended to serve as a template/prototype for the hands-on part of a Machine Learning in Chemical Engineering (MLCE) course. 
This was a collective effort between the Otto von Guericke University, Magdeburg and Imperial College London to share experiences and material 
used in the respective MLCE courses offered in these institutions.

Check out the content of the book:
